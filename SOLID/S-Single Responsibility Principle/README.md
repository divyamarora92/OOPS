# Single Responsibility Principle

## Definition

SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.This principle helps in building cohesive and maintainable code.

## How does SRP improve Maintainability and Scalability?

SRP improves maintainability by making the codebase more modular.
When each class has a single responsibility, changes in one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts.
This modularity also enhances scalability, as it's easier to add new features without affecting existing functionality.

## How does SRP relate to other SOLID principles?

**Open/Closed Principle:** Adhering to SRP makes it easier to extend classes without modifying existing code.
**Interface Segregation Principle:** SRP aligns with keeping interfaces focused and minimal, ensuring clients only use the methods they need.
